"""A standing share link for an automation, created with the project and announced once.

Aditor's Auto Review has no FreeFrame account. That is deliberate - it comments as a guest using
only a share token, which is why it needs no login, no password and no admin invite. The cost is
that it can only see a project somebody has explicitly shared with it, so every project needed a
link created by hand and pasted somewhere. One folder got one; the rest were invisible - not
broken, just unwatched, which is the harder failure to notice.

So: when a project is created, create ONE standing link for the automation and POST it to a
configured URL. The automation learns about the project the moment it exists, and nobody clicks
anything.

Both halves are off by default. No webhook URL configured means none of this runs, and an
instance that does not use an automation behaves exactly as it does now.

Failure here must never fail the project. A share link the automation never hears about is a
project it does not watch; a project that could not be created is an editor who cannot work.
