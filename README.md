FreeFrame gives production houses and creative teams a self-hosted platform for reviewing video, image, and audio assets with frame-accurate commenting, annotations, and approval workflows. Your media stays on your infrastructure.

## Features

- **Video review** with HLS adaptive streaming and frame-accurate timecoded comments
- **Export comments to your NLE** — DaVinci Resolve (marker EDL), Final Cut Pro (FCPXML), Premiere Pro (XML), or CSV
- **Image and audio review** with annotations and waveform visualization
- **Drawing annotations** on any frame using canvas tools
- **Threaded comments** with mentions, reactions, and attachments
- **Approval workflows** with per-reviewer status tracking
- **Version compare** — put any two versions side-by-side or under a wipe slider, with per-version comments and annotations
- **Folder organization** within projects
- **Team collaboration** with role-based permissions (org, team, project levels)
- **Share links** for external reviewers (password-protected, expiring)
- **Guest commenting** via share links (no account required)
- **Due date tracking** with email reminders
- **Real-time updates** via Server-Sent Events
- **Self-hosted** with Docker Compose — runs on any server or cloud VM

### Compare any two versions

Put two cuts or revisions on screen at once and see exactly what changed. Video plays in frame-accurate sync with per-side audio and offset trim for re-edited cuts; images compare side-by-side or under a draggable wipe. Each version keeps its own comment thread and annotations, and the whole view is shareable by URL.

### Take comments straight into your edit

Export a version's timecoded comments as timeline markers your editor can import — DaVinci Resolve (marker EDL), Final Cut Pro (FCPXML), Premiere Pro (XML), or CSV — so notes land on the exact frame back in the timeline.

### Share with clients — no accounts needed

Send a link; clients review and comment without signing up. You stay in control of every link: comments/downloads permissions, passphrase, expiration date, watermarking, and appearance.

## Quick Start (Development)

**Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe.git
cd freeframe
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access FreeFrame. The first user to sign up becomes the super admin.

**Services running in dev:**

| Service     | URL                          |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| Frontend    | http://localhost:3000         |
| API         | http://localhost:8000         |
| API Docs    | http://localhost:8000/docs    |
| MinIO Console | http://localhost:9001       |

### Access from other devices on your network (LAN)

By default the dev stack is reachable only from the host machine (`localhost`). To open FreeFrame from a phone or another computer on the same network, point a few URLs at your machine's LAN IP — find it with `ipconfig getifaddr en0` (macOS) or `hostname -I` (Linux) — then recreate the containers.

In `.env` (replace `192.168.1.50` with your IP):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.1.50:8000   # web → API (baked into the browser bundle)
FRONTEND_URL=http://192.168.1.50:3000           # links in invite emails
CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=*                            # API allows the LAN browser origin
S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=http://192.168.1.50:9000     # presigned upload/download URLs
MINIO_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN=*                       # MinIO allows the LAN browser origin
```

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --force-recreate
```

Then browse to `http://192.168.1.50:3000` from any device on the network. Server-side settings (`DATABASE_URL`, `S3_ENDPOINT`, …) stay on their docker-internal hostnames — only the browser-facing URLs above change.

> The `*` wildcards are LAN-testing conveniences — don't use them in production. See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for a locked-down setup.

## Release channels

Production self-hosters should run a **released** version, not `main`:

| Ref | What it is | Use it if… |
|-----|-----------|------------|
| `stable` | The latest release we've validated — a bad release is never promoted here. | **Production (safe default):** `git clone -b stable …`, then `git pull` to update. |
| `latest` | The newest published release (moves on every release). | You want new features sooner and can tolerate the occasional regression. |
| `v1.3.1` (any `vX.Y.Z`) | An immutable, pinned release. | You want to pin an exact version: `git checkout v1.3.1`. |
| `main` | Active development; may be unreleased or unstable. | You're developing or contributing to FreeFrame. |

Release notes are on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/releases). Maintainers: see [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).

## Production Deployment

```bash
git clone -b stable https://github.com/Techiebutler/freeframe.git
cd freeframe
cp .env.example .env.prod
# Edit .env.prod — set your credentials, S3, email config
# For SSL: also set DOMAIN and ACME_EMAIL (Traefik auto-provisions Let's Encrypt certs)
docker compose --env-file .env.prod -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

For the full guide including **SSL setup**, **bring-your-own infrastructure** (external database, Redis, S3, SMTP), scaling, and troubleshooting, see:
